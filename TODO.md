## Implementation Notes

1. **Dependencies Between Components:**
   - Fiber implementation must be complete before any I/O or sync primitives
   - Basic scheduler must be working before implementing advanced scheduling
   - Worker thread pool should be implemented before file I/O operations

2. **Key Implementation Decisions:**
   - Choose between available context switching libraries (context, corosensei)
   - Decide on task representation and lifecycle management
   - Determine how to integrate with mio's event system
   - Design API to be similar to std library where possible

3. **Reference Materials:**
   - Study mio documentation for event loop implementation
   - Review tokio's reactor code for good practices
   - Reference mioco's original implementation approach
   - Examine other green-thread implementations (Go runtime, libdill)

4. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Test each component in isolation first
   - Create integration tests for component interactions
   - Develop stress tests for concurrency issues

## Future Considerations
- [ ] Platform support
  - [ ] Windows support
  - [ ] macOS support
  - [ ] Various Linux distributions
  
- [ ] Additional features
  - [ ] Integration with async/await syntax
  - [ ] Custom allocator support
  - [ ] Monitoring and metrics
  - [ ] Hot reloading capability

## Notes
- Focus on maintaining compatibility with latest mio versions
- Keep the API simple and similar to std library
- Ensure proper documentation at each step
- Regular security audits
- Performance benchmarking against similar solutions

## Contributing Guidelines
- Follow Rust coding standards
- Ensure all new features have tests
- Document all public APIs
- Benchmark performance impacts
- Review security implications
