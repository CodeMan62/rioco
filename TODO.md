## Notes
- Focus on maintaining compatibility with latest mio versions
- Keep the API simple and similar to std library
- Ensure proper documentation at each step
- Regular security audits
- Performance benchmarking against similar solutions

## Contributing Guidelines
- Follow Rust coding standards
- Ensure all new features have tests
- Document all public APIs
- Benchmark performance impacts
- Review security implications
